# Lit Components MCP Integration Project Plan

## Project Overview

This project aims to build a system that:
- Manages Lit components via a backend API
- Stores component data in a MongoDB database
- Integrates with an MCP server
- Connects with AI tools like Claude and Cursor for intelligent discovery

---

## System Architecture

**Core Components:**
- GitHub Repository (source of Lit components)  
- Component Parser (extracts metadata)  
- MongoDB (component storage)  
- Express.js API (management layer)  
- MCP Integration Layer  
- Claude/Cursor Interface

## Phase 1: Component Storage

### Key Goals:
- Design a schema for Lit component metadata
- Store source code, properties, events, and tags
- Support full-text and tag-based search
- Implement utility functions for CRUD operations

---

## Phase 2: Component Management API

### Key Goals:
- Set up Express.js server with routes for component management
- Create API endpoints for:
  - Creating, reading, updating, and deleting components
  - Searching and filtering components
  - Managing component dependencies
- Integrate with the parser service for metadata extraction from code

---

## Phase 3: MCP Server Integration

### Key Goals:
- Develop a client service to communicate with the MCP API
- Transform stored components to MCPâ€™s expected format
- Register components and track status
- Implement sync logic and manual trigger endpoints

---

## Phase 4: Claude/Cursor Integration

### Key Goals:
- Build AI-friendly endpoints to support component lookup
- Parse natural language queries and match with components
- Format results with code snippets and documentation
- Provide AI tools with ranked and filtered suggestions

---

## Development Environment

**Setup:**
- Use Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB, Git, and a code editor
- Maintain separate configs for development and production
- Follow best practices (linting, testing, version control)
